	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// The JSON schema is the lowest common denominator of most
	/// modern computer languages, and allows parsing JSON files.
	/// A YAML processor should therefore support this schema,
	/// at least as an option.
	/// It is also strongly recommended that other schemas
	/// should be based on it.
